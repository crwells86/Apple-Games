# About SpriteKit

SpriteKit is a general-purpose framework for drawing shapes, particles, text, images, and video in two dimensions. It leverages Metal to achieve high-performance rendering, while offering a simple programming interface to make it easy to create games and other graphics-intensive apps. Using a rich set of animations and physics behaviors, you can quickly add life to your visual elements and gracefully transition between screens.
SpriteKit is supported in iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS, and it integrates well with frameworks such as GameplayKit and SceneKit. You can use SpriteKit in a compatible iPhone or iPad app running in visionOS, but donâ€™t use it in apps you create specifically for visionOS.
